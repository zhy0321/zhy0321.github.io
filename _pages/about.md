I am Yue Zhan (战悦 in Chinese), I am pursuing my doctoral degree from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://iis.bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Tangwen Yang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7995/).
Before that, I received my master’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University and Bs degree from ‌Southwest Jiaotong University. My research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. In particular, my work focuses on multimodal large language model, embodied intelligence,  and continual domain adaptation.


<h2 id='research-interests'>Research Interests</h2>

Currently, my research mainly centers on 

* **Multimodal large language model**: Vision-Language large model, Efficient fine-tuning, Model data leakage.
* **Crowd behavior analysis**: Crowd counting and localization, abnormal behavior detection.
* **Data-efficient learning**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL), Few-shot learning.
* **Continual learning**: Continual unsupervised domain adaptation(CUDA), Test-time adaptation(TTA).
