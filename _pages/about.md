I am Yue Zhan (战悦 in Chinese), I am pursuing my doctoral degree from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://iis.bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Tangwen Yang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7995/).
Before that, I received my master’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University and bachelor's degree from ‌Southwest Jiaotong University. My research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. In particular, my work focuses on embodied intelligence, object pose estimation and grasping, and test time adaptation.


<h2 id='research-interests'>Research Interests</h2>

Currently, my research mainly centers on 

* **Object pose estimation**: Category-level object pose estimation, new object pose estimation.
* **Robot grasp and manipulation**: Grasping and manipulation based on object affordance.
* **Data-efficient learning**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL), Few-shot learning.
* **Continual learning**: Continual unsupervised domain adaptation(CUDA), Test-time adaptation(TTA).
